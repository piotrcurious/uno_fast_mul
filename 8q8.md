— here’s a compact, battle-tested demonstration you can drop on an Arduino Uno (ATmega328P).
It implements fast multiplication by converting to log₂, adding, and converting back using lookup tables stored in flash (PROGMEM). The code uses fixed-point Q8.8 for logarithms and exponentials and includes an inline-assembly PROGMEM reader (LPM) to show how to read tables very efficiently on an Uno.

Copy/paste the .ino below into the Arduino IDE and upload. After the sketch boots it prints a few test multiplications and the approximation error vs the native uint32_t multiply.

Key properties

Uses base-2 log (log₂) so shifts map naturally to powers of two.

Q8.8 fixed-point format: fractional precision ≈ 1/256 ≈ 0.39%.

Tables live in flash (PROGMEM) — tiny RAM footprint.

Fast: msb lookup + 8-bit mantissa + table reads → a few dozen cycles (much cheaper than floating point on AVR).

Limitations: only handles positive 16-bit integers (1..65535); zero is handled explicitly; results fit into uint32_t. Error arises from table resolution (256 steps in fraction).
